## Final Degree Project
This final degree project studies the __values of the physical magnitudes of a star__ (mass, pressure, temperature and luminosity) as a function of its radius. To do this, we have performed a stellar interior numerical model, involving a numerical integration based on the method of differences. This integration has been carried out in __two ways__, integrating in phases from the surface to the center of the star, and also integrating in phases from the center to the surface. The method seeks to study through the relative error, which differ the values of the physical quantities in the transition between the radioactive envelope and the convective nucleus, __varying the initial value__ of the initial quantities to reduce the relative error. The main objective has been to know how the values of the physical magnitudes evolve along the radius of the star, with the aim to study which are the __predominant nuclear reactions__ in the center of the star, and how the initial chemical composition depends on the final values of the magnitudes. The conclusion reached in this study is what we have demonstrated that carbon-nitrogen cycles are the predominant type of nuclear reaction in the convective nucleus when the star reaches a central temperature greater than $17\cdot10^6K$, due to the chemical composition of the star
