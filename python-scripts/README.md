## Graphs:
To obtain a compound graph with all the parameters depending on 
the radius, run:
    Compound_Main.py
 
To obtain a separared graph with all the parameters depending 
on the radius, run:
    Separated_Main-py
    
To obtain the Relative Error with Temperature graph, run:
    Plot-Temperature.py
 
To obtain the Relative Error with Radius-Luminosity graph, run:
    Plot-Radius-Luminosity.py
    
To obtain both graphs, run:
    Plot-Compound.py
    
   
All of them studies of the parameters that minimaze the relative error.
To get the printed values you have to run any of the two scrips that
have been mencionated at the begining.

For simplicity, all the scripts have been ejecutaded and the images 
of the graphs are in the Images directory.
